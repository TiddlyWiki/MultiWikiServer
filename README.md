# MultiWikiServer
MultiWikiServer for TiddlyWiki

### How to run

- Clone the repo
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

The server runs on port 5000, wildcard host. The entry point is at the end of `src/server.ts`.

At this commit, the server is running with the new routes and they are calling the old `store` and `store.adminWiki`.
