# MultiWikiServer

MultiWikiServer for TiddlyWiki.

### How to run

The init command creates a new folder and installs what you need to get started. 

- `npm init @tiddlywiki/mws@latest mws`
- `cd mws`
- `npm start`

You can customize the defaults by modifying `mws.run.mjs`.

- the server runs on port `5000`. It does not use HTTPS by default, but you can enable it by specifying a key and cert. 
- A `localpass.key` file is created to hold the password keyfile. If this file changes, all passwords will need to be reset. 
- The data folder (`wikiPath`) is `wiki` by default.

The initial user created on first run has the username `admin` and password `1234`.

If you run into trouble, or need help figuring something out, feel free to [start a discussion](https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/MultiWikiServer/discussions). If you know what's wrong, you can also open an issue.


### Updates

This is the process for updating to a new version of MWS.

- Copy or zip your `store` folder to **a safe backup folder**.
- `npm install @tiddlywiki/mws@latest`
- Run `npm start`. This will update the database schema automatically if there are new changes.

If there are any database changes, MWS should pick them up and apply them. The changes are generated by prisma's builtin migration and are supposed to preserve data, but backups are still highly recommended.

### Development

If you want to work on the project, 

- `git clone https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/MultiWikiServer`
- `npm install`
- `cd react-user-mgmt`
- `npm install`
- `cd ..`
- `npm run certs` - if you want https
- `npm start` - this runs the build and test every time, but it's pretty fast

You can change the listeners as explained in the mws.dev.mjs file.

### The Server

- Supports HTTP and HTTPS listeners. All requests are funneled into one stack.
- Uses abstractions and state objects to make the server as flexible as possible.
- Supports overriding classes to implement custom handling of various features.
- All of the features from the old MWS branch have been converted to the new system.

### The Store

- Written using Prisma and entirely promise-based.
- Swapping to a different database engine should be a breeze. For sqlite it uses the libsql adapter, which also allows connections to libsql servers.
- The tiddler text attachment system, which stores some tiddler bodies on the file system, is promise-based and can be modified to store files in the cloud.

### The Features

- Bag & Recipe system for storing tiddlers.
- User and Role management with ACL.
- Attachment system for storing binary tiddlers on the file system.
- Various import and export commands (currently still in development).
- Customization of these features should be quite easy as they are fairly self-contained. The TypeScript code is fully typed and easy to navigate.

### Planned (hopefully) for the future

- AuthJS or a similar integration that supports third-party OAuth (you can already write your own).
- Compiling filters to SQL to optimize memory on both the client and server.
- Support for other database and storage systems. Most likely MariaDB and Postgres.
- Additional recipe strategies with features like prefixed bags and namespaces.
- Server rendering of pages, for a more wikipedia-like experience.
