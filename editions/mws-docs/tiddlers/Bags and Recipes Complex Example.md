A more complex example might be for a teacher working with a group of students:

- **student-{name}** bag for each students work
- **teacher-course** bag for the coursework, editable by the teacher
- **teacher-tools** bag for custom tools used by the teacher

Those bags would be exposed through the following hosted wikis:

- **student-{name}** hosted wiki for each students work, including the coursework material
- **teacher-course** hosted wiki for the coursework, editable by the teacher
- **teacher** hosted wiki for the teacher, bringing together all the bags, giving them an overview of all the students work
