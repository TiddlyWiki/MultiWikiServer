A very simple example of the recipe/bag model might be for a single user who maintains the following bags:

* ''recipes'' - tiddlers related to cooking recipes
* ''work'' - tiddlers related to work
* ''app'' - common tiddlers for customising TiddlyWiki

Those bags would be used with the following recipes:

* ''recipes'' --> recipes, app - wiki for working with recipes, with common custom components
* ''work'' --> work, app - wiki for working with work, with common custom components
* ''app'' --> app - wiki for maintaining custom components

All of this will work dynamically, so changes to the app bag will instantly ripple into the affected hosted wikis.
