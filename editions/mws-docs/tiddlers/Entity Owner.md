When a user creates an [[Entity]], they can optionally become the owner of the entity. Owners have full [[permission|Entity Permissions]] over the entity. There can only be one or no owner of an entity. 

Entity owners can not transfer ownership to another user. Only [[site admins|Site Admin]] can change ownership.
