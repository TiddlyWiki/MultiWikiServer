!! ~TiddlyWiki is Growing Up

<span class="tc-float-right">[img width=200 [MWS Banner.png]]</span>
~MultiWikiServer is a new development that drastically improves ~TiddlyWiki's capabilities when running as a server under Node.js. It brings ~TiddlyWiki up to par with common web-based tools like ~WordPress or ~MediaWiki by supporting multiple wikis and multiple users at the same time.

Planned features include:

* Hosting multiple wikis at once, using the [[Bags and Recipes]] mechanism for sharing data between them
* Full support for SQLite, as well as MariaDB/MySQL, Postgres, and Microsoft SQL Server
* Robust built-in synchronisation handlers for syncing data to the filesystem
* Flexible authentication and authorisation options
* Improved handling of file uploads and attachments, allowing gigabyte video files to be uploaded and streamed
* Instantaneous synchronisation of changes between the server and all connected clients
* Workflow processing on the server, for example to automatically compress images, or to archive webpages

MWS is currently [[under development at GitHub|https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/MultiWikiServer]] but it is already functional and usable, [[except for user security|Security]].
