List > detail (summary) > detail (edit)

In mobile, just a list view. 
  Tapping it brings up a bottom or side sheet detail view. 

In tablet, a list view on the left, and a detail view on the right. 
  Tapping an item opens the detail view on the right. 

In desktop, same as tablet with an improved detail view. 

Clicking edit brings up a full edit page, with separate responsiveness. 

Wide view should be fixed width above desktop view

Some kind of nice looking border and background.
